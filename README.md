# Bulk set your Facebook posts to private

an Automation tool that sets posts in facebook's activity log to private for the new 2020 design.  
this script attempts to resolve the need to set to private your entire posts history.
Previously this was easily doable with a simple for loop but since the new 2020 design it is not.  
## Notes:
**please enable(temporarily) popups on facebook to use this script.**  
As it is currently the activity log cannot show iteratively more than about 40-50 posts without redirecting, thus solved with popups.
## Installation
1) download TamperMonkey/GreaseMonkey(untested) for chrome or firefox respectively and go to the url: 
2) install the script from: [greasyfork](https://greasyfork.org/en/scripts/411305-facebook-set-posts-to-private)
## Usage

   * Search for activity log in facebook's search (usually first result)
